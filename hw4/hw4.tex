\section*{Problem 9}
For this problem I created a ''whitelist". which was all of the characters on the ASCII table. I used HTML entity encoding to encode each character on the ASCII table with it's HTML equivalent. If the character is not an ASCII character it is not included in the text, thus, my encoding would have to be extended for other languages but I assume English was all that was expected for this assignment.\\
I followed rules \#1, \#2, and \#3 of OWASP's XSS prevention rules found here: \url{https://www.owasp.org/index.php/XSS\_\%28Cross\_Site\_Scripting\%29\_Prevention\_Cheat\_Sheet}
